# Comparison Heap

## Description
A "priority list" that stores items in a heap rather than a list to reduce the
number of comparisons needed to determine the highest priority item.

To open a saved file, provide the filename as the first command line argument,
otherwise the program starts with an empty heap:

`./main.py [filename]`

## Commands
`i` - Insert item

`d` - Delete item

`m` - Move item

`r` - Rename item

`q` - Save and quit

`Esc` - Cancel command
